By default, this is the directory where tskeleton searches for 
skeletons. This directory may contain three types of files:

    1. Manually configured skeletons, loaded from an autocommand. 
       Example: This will load a file plain.txt from this directory when 
       creating new files whose extension is "txt":
            autocmd BufNewFile *.txt TSkeletonSetup plain.txt

    2. Automatically configured skeletons are kept in the "templates" 
       subdirectory. tskeleton will automatically define suitable 
       autocommands for you. The effect of the above example could also 
       be achieved by saving the template as
       ".../templates/text/text #.vim"

    3. "Bits" are skeletons for small portions of code. These are saved 
       in the "bits" subdirectory. Example: The bits for, say, vimscript 
       files are kept in ".../bits/vim/"
